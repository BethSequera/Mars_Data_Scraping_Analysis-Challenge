# Mars Data Scraping and Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains the code and data for a two-part project that involves web scraping and analysis of Mars-related data. The project consists of two deliverables:

1. **Deliverable 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News**
    - In this part, we scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.
    - The code for this is located in the Jupyter Notebook `part_1_mars_news.ipynb`.

2. **Deliverable 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data**
    - In this part, we scrape and analyze Mars weather data that is presented in an HTML table.
    - The code for this is located in the Jupyter Notebook `part_2_mars_weather.ipynb`.

## Getting Started

To run the code and reproduce the analysis, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mars-data-scraping.git
```

2. **Dependencies**: Make sure you have the required dependencies installed. You can install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4 pandas jupyter
```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebooks**: Start Jupyter Notebook and open the respective notebooks for each deliverable:

    - For Deliverable 1, open `part_1_mars_news.ipynb`.
    - For Deliverable 2, open `part_2_mars_weather.ipynb`.

4. **Follow the Instructions**: Execute the cells in the notebooks step by step, following the instructions provided in each.

## Data

- The scraped Mars news titles and preview text from Deliverable 1 are stored in a JSON file, `mars_news.json`.

- The scraped Mars weather data from Deliverable 2 is stored in a CSV file, `mars_weather_data.csv`.

## Analysis

In Deliverable 2, we analyze the Mars weather data to answer several questions such as the number of months on Mars, the coldest and warmest months, and more. The results and visualizations can be found in the notebook.

## Results

The main results and findings from this project are as follows:

- **Deliverable 1**: We have successfully scraped and stored Mars news titles and preview text in a structured format.

- **Deliverable 2**: We have scraped, cleaned, and analyzed Mars weather data, answering various questions about Martian weather patterns.

## Future Improvements

Future improvements to this project could include:

- Automating data scraping at regular intervals to keep the dataset up-to-date.
- Creating a web dashboard to visualize and interact with the data.
- Expanding the analysis to include more Mars-related data sources.
